# FSAS: AFM Force Spectroscopy Analysis Software (MatLab version)

Graphical interface for analysis of AFM force ramps and force volume files.

Developer: [Javier Sotres](https://mah.se/sotres).

Developed with App Designer in MatLab R2019a. If you want to modify the code of the apps you 
should work with this or later versions. If you just want to run the software, some older versions 
might work (at least 2017 versions). If you are interested in using the software, please refer to 
the [User Manual](./FSAS_MANUAL.md).

At present, FSAS only reads force ramps and force volume files obtained with the Bruker Nanoscope software.
However, please [contact me](https://mah.se/sotres) if you are interested in reading files obtained with different 
AFMs/softwares.
