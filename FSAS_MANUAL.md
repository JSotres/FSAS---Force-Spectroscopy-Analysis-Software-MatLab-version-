# FSAS 0.1 Quick reference manual

## 1. Quick start
1. Clone/Download the repository
2. Open Matlab
3. Go to the FSAS folder
2. From the Matlab command prompt run:
```
>>FSAS;
```
This will open the FSAS main app

## 2. FSAS main app
### 2.1. Load Menu
From here you can load both files previously saved with the FSAS software and Nanoscope files
#### 2.1.1 FSAS
Load files previously saved with the FSAS software (both force ramps and force volume files).
#### 2.1.2 Nanoscope
Load force ramps and force volume files obtained with the Bruker Nanoscope software.

Different apps will open depending on wether [force ramps](#force-ramp-analysis-app) or a [force volume](#force-volume-analysis-app) file are loaded.

### Graphical Interface
The graphical interface contains two axes. The one on the left is used for plotting force ramps.
The one in the right is used for plotting maps. By maps we refer to either the topography (height)
of the sample, or a characteristic quantity calculated for each pixel/point of the scanned area. 
Typically, this will be a quantity obtained from a given analysis of the force ramp corresponding to
the specific pixel.
Below the Force Ramp Axes there are edit boxes for setting limits of the force ramp plots in both
horizontal and vertical dimensions.
Below the Map Axes there are buttons for navigating along the map. As one navigates along the map, 
the ramp shown in the Ramp Axes changes so that it always represents that obtained in the pixel/point
highlighted in the Map.
At the right of the map, a text area is shown with different quantities associted with the current visualized pint/ramp.
